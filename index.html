<h1> 500 Words </h1>

<p>
  
<p> <em> Five hundred words </em> is a small project that I started for myself as a means to flex and workout my own personal writing muscles. <p>

<p> Something like a personal writing bootcamp or a long form challenge, 500 words is about spending time with myself and with the english language. It is a certain kind of intimacy that I believe in and want everyone to take the time to invest in. <p>
